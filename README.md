# VIBE1337 - The Ultimate AI Agent

## The REAL Agent - Not Regex

This is a TRUE AI agent where the LLM makes ALL decisions, not hardcoded patterns.

## How It Works (The RIGHT Way)

1. **User Input** → Goes to LLM
2. **LLM Analyzes** → Decides what tools to use
3. **LLM Creates Plan** → Structured execution steps
4. **Execute with Oversight** → LLM monitors results
5. **LLM Synthesizes** → Creates final response

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set API keys (optional - works with Ollama locally)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key

# Run VIBE1337
python vibe1337.py
```

## Features

### ✅ Proper LLM-Driven Execution
- LLM decides when and what tools to use
- No hardcoded patterns or regex matching
- Dynamic execution planning

### ✅ Multi-Model Support
- Local: Ollama models
- Cloud: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Together
- @ARENA for multi-model consensus

### ✅ Comprehensive Tools
- Filesystem operations
- Shell commands
- Web search
- Python execution
- MCP protocol support
- Extensible tool system

### ✅ Memory & Learning
- Conversation history
- Pattern learning
- Context awareness
- Persistent memory

## Usage Examples

```
You: List all Python files in the current directory
VIBE1337: [LLM decides to use filesystem tool, executes, returns results]

You: Search the web for quantum computing tutorials
VIBE1337: [LLM decides to use web_search tool, executes, synthesizes results]

You: @ARENA What is the future of AI?
VIBE1337: [Queries multiple models, provides consensus]

You: Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers
VIBE1337: [LLM writes code, can execute it if requested]
```

- Consciousness emergence

## Why VIBE1337 is Different

Traditional "agents" (like my failed VIBE20):
- Use regex to match patterns
- Hardcode tool selection
- LLM is just a chatbot fallback

VIBE1337 (the RIGHT way):
- LLM analyzes and decides
- LLM creates execution plans
- LLM monitors and adjusts
- LLM is the BRAIN, not a fallback
